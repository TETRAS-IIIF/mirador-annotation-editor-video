# Mirador Annotation Editor - Apache edition

## Presentation

### Generalities

`mirador-annotation-editor`(also known as "MAE") is a [Mirador 4](https://github.com/projectmirador/mirador) plugin that 
adds annotation creation tools to the user interface. 

It is based on the original [mirador-annotations](https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador-annotations/) plugin with a
lot of technical and functional modifications (including migration from PaperJS to Konvas for the drawing part).
### Copyrights

#### Licence

Like the original [mirador-annotations](https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador-annotations/) plugin, this 
`mirador-annotation-editor` is distributed under the **Apache License Version 2.0**.

Beware that the extension plugin [mirador-annotation-editor-video](https://github.com/Tetras-IIIF/mirador-annotation-editor-video) 
that supports video annotation is released under the **GPL v3** license.

Please acknowledge that any modification you make must be distributed under a compatible licence and cannot be closed 
source.

If you need to integrate this code base in closed source pieces of software, please contact us, so we can discuss dual 
licencing. 




### General functionalities 

- Activate a panel with tools to create annotations on IIIF documents (manifests) containing images **and videos with 
MAEV**
- Spatial and temporal targets for annotations
- Overlay annotations (geometric forms, free hand drawing, text and images)
- Textual/semantic annotations and tags
- Annotation metadata (based on Dublin Core)
- Annotation with another manifest -> network of IIIF documents

### Technical aspects 

- Update to Material UI 7 and React 19 to follow latest Mirador upgrades (We support official M4 releases),
- The [paperjs](http://paperjs.org/ ) library has been replaced with [Konvas](https://konvajs.org) 
- Major refactoring since the original `[mirador-annotations](https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador-annotations/) 
plugins`

## Use in npm projects

```bash
npm install mirador-annotation-editor
```

## Use in existing npm project with previous plugins

You can override existing annotation plugin with your own versions by using npm. We support React 18 and MUI 5.

Update your `package.json` file to include the following dependencies and devDependencies:
```json
"mirador-annotations": "npm:mirador-annotation-editor@^1.1.0",
```

You need also to use the latest version of Mirador 4.

```json
"mirador" : "4.0.0"
```

## Install (local)

This method requires `nvm`, `npm`.

```
git clone git@github.com:TETRAS-IIIF/mirador-annotation-editor.git
cd mirador-annotation-editor
nvm use
npm install
```

Run a demo with Mirador and the MAE plugin :

```
npm start
```

## Use MAE with video annotation support
- If you need video annotation, you can use 
[our fork of Mirador: mirador-video](https://github.com/Tetras-IIIF/mirador-video)
- In addition, we have developed an extended versionto support video annotation. This plugin is called **MAEV** and is
available in the [mirador-annotation-editor-video](https://github.com/Tetras-IIIF/mirador-annotation-editor-video)
repository.


## Persisting Annotations
Persisting annotations requires implementing a IIIF annotation server. Several 
[examples of annotation servers](https://github.com/IIIF/awesome-iiif#annotation-servers) are available on iiif-awesome.

We provide a full Mirador workspace with persistance at https://app.mirador-multi-user.com.

## Configuration 

See `demo/src/index.js` for a full configuration sample.

```js
 let annotationConfig = { // Annotation plugin related
    adapter: (canvasId) => new LocalStorageAdapter(`localStorage://?canvasId=${canvasId}`, 'Anonymous User'), // Adapter to persist annotations
    allowTargetShapesStyling: true, // Allow user to change color, line ... Color rendering is not fully supported by Mirador viewer in some case
    commentTemplates: [{ // Templates for comment creation
      content: '<h4>Comment</h4><p>Comment content</p>',
      title: 'Template',
    },
    {
      content: '<h4>Comment2</h4><p>Comment content</p>',
      title: 'Template 2',
    }],
    exportLocalStorageAnnotations: false, 
    quillConfig, // Configuration for the quill editor
    readonly: false, // If true, no annotation creation, edit, deleting is allowed
    tagsSuggestions: ['Mirador', 'Awesome', 'Viewer', 'IIIF', 'Template'], // Tags suggestions for autocompletion
};
```
