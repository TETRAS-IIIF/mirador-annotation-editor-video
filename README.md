# Mirador Annotation Editor - Apache edition

## Presentation

### Generalities

`mirador-annotation-editor`(also known as "MAE") is a [Mirador 4](https://github.com/projectmirador/mirador) plugin that 
adds annotation creation tools to the user interface. 

It is based on the original [mirador-annotations](https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador-annotations/) plugin with a
lot of technical and functional modifications and forked from https://github.com/ARVEST-APP/mirador-annotation-editor

### General functionalities 

- Activate a panel with tools to create annotations on IIIF documents (manifests) containing images **and videos with 
MAEV**
- Spatial and temporal targets for annotations
- Overlay annotations (geometric forms, free hand drawing, text and images)
- Textual/semantic annotations and tags
- Annotation metadata (based on Dublin Core)
- Annotation with another manifest -> network of IIIF documents

### Technical aspects 

- Update to Material UI 5 and React 18 to follow latest Mirador upgrades (We support mirador": "4.0.0-alpha.2",
- The [paperjs](http://paperjs.org/ ) library has been replaced with [Konvas](https://konvajs.org) 
- Major refactoring since the original `[mirador-annotations](https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador-annotations/) 
plugins`
- Works with the original [Mirador 4](https://github.com/projectmirador/mirador) if you need only image annotation

## Use in npm projects

```bash
npm install mirador-annotation-editor
```

## Use in existing npm project with previous plugins

You can override existing annotation plugin with your own versions by using npm. We support React 18 and MUI 5.

Update your `package.json` file to include the following dependencies and devDependencies:
```js
"mirador-annotations": "npm:mirador-annotation-editor@^1.0.10",
```

You need also to use the latest version of Mirador 4.

```js
"mirador" : "4.0.0-alpha.2",
```

If you encounter this error : 

```js
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'mirador-annotations/es/LocalStorageAdapter' in '/home/anthony/Documents/2024-scene/mirador-integration/src'
```
Update your import :

```js
# Change your LocalStorageAdapter path import
import LocalStorageAdapter from 'mirador-annotations/es/LocalStorageAdapter';
# To that
import LocalStorageAdapter from 'mirador-annotations/es/annotationAdapter/LocalStorageAdapter';
```

You can find an example of integration in our Mirador-integration repository : 
https://github.com/SCENE-CE/mirador-integration

## Install (local)

This method requires `nvm`, `npm`.

```
git clone git@github.com:SCENE-CE/mirador-annotation-editor.git
cd mirador-annotation-editor
nvm use
npm install
```

Run a demo with Mirador and the MAE plugin :

```
npm start
```

## Use MAE with video annotation support
- If you need video annotation, you can use 
[our fork of Mirador: mirador-video](https://github.com/SCENE-CE/mirador-video)
- In addition, we have developed a wrapper of MAE to support video annotation. This wrapper is called **MAEV** and is
available in the [mirador-annotation-editor-video](https://github.com/SCENE-CE/mirador-annotation-editor-video)
repository.


## Persisting Annotations
Persisting annotations requires implementing a IIIF annotation server. Several 
[examples of annotation servers](https://github.com/IIIF/awesome-iiif#annotation-servers) are available on iiif-awesome.

`mirador-annotation-editor` currently supports adapters for 
[annotot](https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador-annotations/blob/master/src/AnnototAdapter.js) and 
[local storage](https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador-annotations/blob/master/src/LocalStorageAdapter.js). We 
welcome contributions of adapters for other annotation servers.
